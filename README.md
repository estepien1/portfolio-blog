### **Portfolio-blog**

This repository contains the files and code that I have used to build my first [Quarto](https://quarto.org) blog. To make it happen, I used the [guidance](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/#so-here-comes-quarto) provided by [Beatriz Milz](https://github.com/beatrizmilz) and the following Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html). You can access the blog [**here**](https://estepien.netlify.app/).

### **Reasons for starting my own blog**

I've enjoyed building this blog from the scratch not only because it's an excellent challenge that allows me to practice my R coding skills, but also stimulates my creativity.

### **Content overview**

The blog contains posts relating to the projects I work on and a section where I share more about myself.
