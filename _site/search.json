    "text": "After reading some blog posts about other people’s transition to data analytics and coding, I thought that it is worth to reflect on my own journey and share it in the first post on this blog.\nAlthough I officially started to learn coding in R in 2022, my experience with analysing data to tell stories dates back as far as 2017.\n\n\n1. Stepping into the world of data and statistics\nI had always been fascinated with human behaviour, therefore deciding to study psychology was a natural choice for me.\nWhile completing my undergraduate degree at Manchester Metropolitan University, I became a member of research club where I developed interest in using neuropsychological data to tell stories about one’s emotional state.\nDuring this degree, I also learnt the basics of statistics and how to generate first data insights using IBM SPSS. Despite enjoying using this software, I felt that managing larger data set was difficult and available data visualisations could have been improved. It was around 2018 when I first heard about R. However, being busy with university schedule and part-time work delayed digging into this topic further at the time.\n\n\n2. Even more data management\nFast forward to 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree just as the pandemic started and then worked remotely as a student advisor in a financial education company. In this role, I learnt data management using enterprise resource planning software, namely Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and advanced data management using Excel.\n\n\n3. Back in academia\nIn 2021, I started a master of science degree in clinical and health psychology at the University of Manchester. As I was completing it on a full-time basis, handling multiple, competing deadlines inspired me to look for ways to make working on my assignments more efficient and organised."
