Hi, I'm Ewelina! I started my official data analytics journey in 2022, although I have been making sense of data since starting my undergraduate degree in 2017.

In my free time, I enjoy solving [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges and attending concerts (current count: 25 gigs!).
