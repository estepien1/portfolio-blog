Hi! I'm Ewelina. I started my data analytics journey in *2022*, when I developed interests in using R to optimise working on my postgraduate statistics assignments.

I particularly enjoy solving [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges to develop my *R proficiency* and recently explored the world of *SQL*.
