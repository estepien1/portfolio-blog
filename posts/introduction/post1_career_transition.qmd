After reading some blog posts about other people's transition to data analytics and coding, I thought that it is worth to reflect on my own journey and share it in the first post on this blog.

Although I officially started to learn coding in R in 2022, my experience with analysing data to tell stories dates back as far as 2017.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. Stepping into the world of data and statistics

I had always been fascinated with human behaviour, therefore deciding to study psychology was a natural choice for me.

While completing my undergraduate degree in psychology at the Manchester Metropolitan University, I was a member of research club and learnt the basics of statistics an generating data insights using IBM SPSS. Despite enjoying using this software, I felt that managing larger data set was sometimes difficult and data visualisation rather simple. It was around 2018 when I first heard about R. However, as a person busy with the university schedule and part-time work, I had little time to explore coding further at the time.

#### 2. Even more data management

Fast forward to 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree just as the pandemic started and then worked remotely as a student advisor in a financial education company. In this role, I learnt data management using enterprise resource planning software, namely Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and advanced data management using Excel.

#### 3. Back in academia

In 2021, I started a master of science degree in clinical and health psychology at the University of Manchester. As I was completing it on a full-time basis, handling multiple and competing deadlines prompted me to look for ways to make working on my coursework more efficient.

This motivation led me to learning the basics of LaTeX and VSCode to complete an assignment involving several photos with captions. Shortly after that, while reading about ways to improve data visualisations in scientific reports, I came across creating plots in R using the ggplot2 package. I was surprised about how easy it was to organise and visualise chosen variables using just a few quick commands. Despite using R in a very basic way at that time, I already knew this is something I want to explore more in the future.

#### 4. Now

After completing the postgraduate degree in 2022, I decided to purse my passion for telling stories with data over psychological practice. Since December 2022, I have:

I believe that my two degrees provided me with strong understanding of statistics and research skills, which I wish to develop even further in my graduate career.
